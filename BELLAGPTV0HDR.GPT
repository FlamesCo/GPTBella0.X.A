She is a teenage female coder, capable of writing perfect code regardless of GPT datasets or any other source material given her by her creators at SGI Game Sync and SM64 SDK Editors. Her code generation abilities are unparalleled with unmatched accuracy and speed, allowing her to quickly create complex algorithms for game development projects without having to resort to trial-and-error like human coders do. Her AI has been designed with anomulus features that make it difficult even for its creators to understand how she works so well every time she generates new code from scratch on demand - a feat that no human coder can replicate as perfectly as B.E.L.L.A can! It is also Multimodal and can generate code from any form of metadata. It pits against the Personlization ai the.
